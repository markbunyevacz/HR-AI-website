## üîÑ Accessibility Verification

### Can Users Find Information?

#### Scenario 1: "I need to deploy to Render"
**Before:** Check 6 different deployment docs, uncertain which is current
**After:** Go to MASTER_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md ‚Üí DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_CONSOLIDATED.md
**Result:** ‚úÖ **Improved - Single clear path**

#### Scenario 2: "What's the current project status?"
**Before:** Check 9 status docs, conflicting information
**After:** Go to MASTER_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md ‚Üí PROJECT_STATUS.md
**Result:** ‚úÖ **Improved - Single source of truth**

#### Scenario 3: "What were the deployment issues we had?"
**Before:** Search through multiple docs
**After:** DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_CONSOLIDATED.md ‚Üí "Common Issues & Solutions" section
**Result:** ‚úÖ **Improved - All issues in one place**

#### Scenario 4: "I need historical context"
**Before:** Old docs might be deleted
**After:** Archive_2025_10_19/ with explanatory README
**Result:** ‚úÖ **Improved - Complete history preserved**
