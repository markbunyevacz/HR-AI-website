## 🔄 Maintenance Guidelines

### Keeping Documentation Consolidated

**DO:**
- ✅ Update consolidated documents when changes occur
- ✅ Add new unique docs when they don't overlap
- ✅ Archive old versions when creating major rewrites

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Create duplicate guides for same topic
- ❌ Split consolidated docs back into pieces
- ❌ Delete archived documents
- ❌ Let documentation drift out of sync
- ❌ Forget to update the master index

### When to Create New Docs
Only create new documentation when:
1. The topic is genuinely new and unique
2. The content doesn't fit in existing consolidated docs
3. The doc serves a specific, non-overlapping purpose
4. You update the master index to reference it

### When to Archive
Archive documentation when:
1. Creating a major rewrite (save old version)
2. Consolidating multiple docs (archive originals)
3. Deprecating a feature (archive related docs)
4. End of project phase (archive phase-specific docs)
