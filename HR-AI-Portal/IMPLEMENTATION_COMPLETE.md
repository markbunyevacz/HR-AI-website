## 🚀 To Run the Database Seeder

The seeder script is ready at `HR-AI-Portal/backend/seed-data.js`

### Prerequisites:
1. Database must be running (PostgreSQL for production, or SQLite for development)
2. Database credentials must be configured in `.env` file
3. All migrations must be applied first

### Run Command:
```bash
cd HR-AI-Portal/backend
node seed-data.js
```

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
# OR for development:
NODE_ENV=development
```

### What the Seeder Does:
1. ✅ Checks for existing users (uses first admin/instructor as course instructor)
2. ✅ Creates 9 CAHIS certification courses
3. ✅ Creates 4 lesson modules for each course (36 total lessons)
4. ✅ Creates 10 blog posts with varied categories
5. ✅ Sets realistic enrollment counts, ratings, and view counts
6. ✅ Marks all content as published and ready

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Ensure database is running and accessible**
   - Check DATABASE_URL in `.env`
   - Verify database connection works

2. **Run the seeder:**
   ```bash
   cd HR-AI-Portal/backend
   node seed-data.js
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd HR-AI-Portal/frontend
   npm start

   # Backend (in separate terminal)
   cd HR-AI-Portal/backend
   npm start
   ```

4. **Test all features:**
   - Register a new account (test password validation)
   - Login and view Dashboard (test new colors)
   - Browse Courses page (test watermark + seeded courses)
   - Read Blog posts (test seeded content)
   - Check Resources page (test fixed link + watermark)

---

## 💡 Notes

1. **Watermarks** are intentionally subtle - they don't interfere with normal use but are visible in screenshots for security
2. **Lorem ipsum content** in lessons and blog posts - replace with actual content before production
3. **All changes are backward compatible** - existing data won't be affected
4. **Seeder is idempotent** - can be run multiple times (will skip if courses already exist)

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that database connection is configured correctly
2. Verify all npm packages are installed
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify backend is running and accessible
