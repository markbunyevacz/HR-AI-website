# Testing Feedback Fixes - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented based on testing feedback.

## âœ… 1. Color Contrast Improvements

- Changed secondary color from `#764ba2` to `#5a3d7f` (darker, better contrast)
- Updated error messages to use `#c41e3a` (stronger red)

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/styles/Dashboard.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/Landing.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/Courses.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/Blog.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/Auth.css`

## ðŸš€ Running the Seeders

### Option 1: Using the seeder script (Recommended)
```bash
cd HR-AI-Portal
node database/run-seeders.js
```

### Option 2: Using Sequelize CLI
```bash
cd HR-AI-Portal/backend
npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed 013-seed-cahis-courses.js
npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed 014-seed-blog-posts.js
```

### Option 3: Manual execution
```bash
cd HR-AI-Portal
node -e "require('./database/migrations/013-seed-cahis-courses').up(require('./backend/src/models').sequelize.getQueryInterface(), require('sequelize'))"
node -e "require('./database/migrations/014-seed-blog-posts').up(require('./backend/src/models').sequelize.getQueryInterface(), require('sequelize'))"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

1. **Watermarks are intentionally subtle** to not interfere with normal use but visible enough in screenshots.
2. **Lorem ipsum content** in blog posts and lesson content - replace with actual content before production.
3. **Course enrollment counts and ratings** are simulated - will be real once users start interacting.
4. **Password validation** is client-side only - server-side validation already exists.
